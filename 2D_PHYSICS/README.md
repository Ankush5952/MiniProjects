<h2>2D PHYSICS</h2>

- A simple Physics Engine capable of performing very simple physics:
  1. Gravity
  2. Collision
  3. Bouncing

- Manipulative Gravity for both axis {x,y}.
- Collision Detection and Resolving for Circles and Rectangles.
- Applying Restitution after collission to create a bouncy effect.

- Currently the engine handles drawing objects for simplicity, but can be paired up with a rendering engine as well.
- Supports shapes like Lines, Circles and Rectangles.

- Window Resizability and Full screen with no ill-effect on physics bodies already present -> automatic position and length adjustment.
